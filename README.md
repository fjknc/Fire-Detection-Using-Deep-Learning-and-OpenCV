# Fire-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-and-OpenCV

## How to run?

1. Run the model.py to train the model to detect fire if you have a dataset else, You can use the model(ip.h5) I have trained. 
	- The logs folder is to show the the different models trained to compare using TensorBoard

2. Run the test.py. This will automatically run contour.py and siren.py
